Instructions:

* Sending and Recieving of messages are done in the same program. So we have to run
  the same program on as many sites as needed. Suppose there are 4 sites, there should be 4 consoles/Terminals opened.

* The processes will not start execution until all processes are started. So please
  make sure that all processes are strated correctly.

* raexe.exe is the executable.

* config.txt is the configuration file. Please make sure that the config.txt file
  is in the same directory as that of RA.c
